# Keras Examples

### Why Should I Care?

Keras is a high level API for Tensorflow (and as a standalone) that
simplifies many of the tasks involved in implementing a ML model. As a
student, incorporating Keras and related high level API entities will:

1. **Save you time** - features that would take time to implement may already
be included in Keras.
2. **Improve readability** - High level APIs can facilitate the writing of clean
and readable code, allowing you to focus on learning the core concepts.
3. **Improve compatibility** - Since high level APIs add a level of abstraction onto the
underlying operations, your code will be more resilient to changes made to these
underlying operations.
